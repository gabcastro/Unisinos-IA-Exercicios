# Exercices of Artificial Intelengice #

## Description ##

This repository contains folders to each week of the subject of Artificial Intelligence of graduation course Computer Science of University of Rio dos Sinos Valley (UNISINOS). 
The main goal here was, resolve a problem applying what we learned during the classes.

Below I share topics with a brief description of what contains in each notebook python.

### Observations ###

1. I used Google Collab to script my notebooks. But it's possible using any other environment.
For exercises before ML, a local machine it's enough. But for what I used in NN, the Collab help me more because it's possible to change to run in a GPU instead of a CPU.

2. My notebooks contemplate some notes from my teacher, and some mines too. But different of this readme, they were write in Portuguese.
